# Declutter
A mod for [Factorio](http://factorio.com) that lets you hide technologies and recipes you don't use.

## Description
Mainly meant for people (like me) who use a lot of mods together, which sometimes results in essentially duplicate technologies / crafting recipes when several mods add the same kind of thing. For example, [Krastorio 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) has its own larger (2x2 and 4x4) containers, but you might prefer ones provided by [AAI Containers](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-containers) or [Angel's Addons - Storage Options](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/angelsaddons-storage). This mod lets you hide whichever you don't use.

## Usage
In `Settings -> Mod Settings -> Startup`, enter the internal names of technologies / recipies you wish to hide in the corresponding fields in Declutter's section. To find out internal names of things, press F4 while in game and enable `show-debug-info-in-tooltips`. Now whenever you hover over a recipe or technology with the cursor, the tooltip will contain additional information, including the name.

## Install/uninstall
The mod only hides recipes and technologies from menus, it does not remove any items or change what's already researched. There should be no problem adding/removing it at any point.
