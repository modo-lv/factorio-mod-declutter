# Declutter
A mod for [Factorio](http://factorio.com) that lets you hide technologies and recipes you don't use.

## Install/uninstall
The mod only hides recipes and technologies from menus, it does not remove any items or change what's already researched. There should be no problem adding/removing it at any point.
